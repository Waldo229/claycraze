<h1><em> Clay</em> </h1>
<strong>The Poor Potter of Yorktown </strong>Neither poor, nor a potter, William Roger's began a pottery in Yorktown, Virginia (date) under the nose of the British government and sold his goods in the colonies profitably, undercutting the price of imports. Nothing to see here, just a poor man trying to make a living, was what his friend the governor was telling the English. Today, the story of William Rogers is all but forgotten, but his clay remains a treasure ripe for rediscovery.
Since 1973, I have crafted pottery with a deep appreciation for Japanese-influenced ceramics. My work reflects a lifelong passion for form and function, deeply inspired by traditional Japanese aesthetics and the balance of nature. After retiring from the Portsmouth Fire Department, I spent three years at the Norfolk Botanical Garden and maintained a small studio at the Hermitage Museum, where I rekindled my dedication to pottery. Norfolk’s cultural connections—through NATO, the Embassy of Japan, and the U.S. National Arboretum—have profoundly shaped my artistic direction.

Today, I create ceramic containers for my garden and offer them to members of my local bonsai club as well as Ikebana International Chapter 1 in Washington, D.C. In collaboration with Ironwood Bonsai in Newport News, Virginia, I aim to reach a broader bonsai audience. Our partnership has included showcasing my pottery at the National Silhouette Show in Kannapolis, North Carolina.
A key focus of my current work is using natural clay sourced from Yorktown, Virginia—the same clay that William Rogers, Virginia’s first potter, used in Colonial times. I call this material "Colonial Clay" to honor the region’s history and heritage while crafting pottery that enhances the beauty and spirit of bonsai arrangements.
The journey begins!<em>Buckle your seatbelt, It's about to get bumppy. </em>.
