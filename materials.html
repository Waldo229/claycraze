<article><h1>Experiments with Local Clay From Virginia's Historic Triangle</h1>English colonial settlers sailed into Virginia's Chesapeake Bay and established the first permanent English colony at Jamestown in 1607. Jamestown was a low and swampy area. It would not take the setters long to figure out the advantages of living further inland and other towns were shortly established. Williamsburg and Yorktown are two, which along with Jamestown, form Virginia's historic triangle. In 1619 the first African slaves were brought to labor in the colonies. The largest of these plantations, known collectively as the James River Plantations, served as hubs of commerce and were the point of entry for British exports. The British maintained strict control over local production of goods in the colonies. So, it is really quite remarkable that <a href="https://www.chipstone.org/article.php/149/Ceramics-in-America-2004/Yorktown%27s-">William Rogers, the poor potter of Yorktown</a>, was able to establish the first colonial pottery to manufacture stoneware goods in North America. 
<p>Recently, I have begun to explore what I believe to be the same clay that William Rogers began using as early as the 1720's. Of course, <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickahominy_people#Eastern_Chickahominy">indigenous populations knew a good thing</a> when they saw it, too. I hope to soon explore the traditional methods and forms they employed. </p>  </article>
