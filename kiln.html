<h3>My Kilns</h3>
<p>Currently, I have two kilns I use for firing my pottery, the "Poor Boy", a Skutt 1027 electric kiln I converted into a gas kiln, and an ancient Gare electric, model 1818. The kiln is rated to fire cone 8. I've taken the Gare to cone 7. I just don't believe in pressing my luck_at least too much. I recently made the decision to invest in a new electric kiln, a Skutt 1027. This kiln will be modern and programable. I ordered it from Clayworks, located in Richmond, Virginia. I've also ordered a rolling stand, which will provide a level of convenience. I have only a small space for my studio, my garage. I hope my experience purchasing this kiln will be of interest to others who are considering having a home studio or acquiring a similar piece of equipment. For the past fifteen years, I have been firing in my back yard, using nothing more than a weed burner to reach temperatures of cones 6-10+. The temperatures can often be uneven between top and bottom, but as they say, knowing your kiln is the key to happiness. It can be done. Over the years, I have refined my techniques and acquired a pyrometer, so I have a better idea of temperature rate of rise and a bit of affirmation when looking at colors. I still employ trusty pyrometric cones to tell me the real story. I even use the old mechanical "Kiln Sitter". When I hear the arm drop, I know I've hit temperature. It's a beautiful sound.  </section>
