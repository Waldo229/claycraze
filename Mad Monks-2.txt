Ask the director of NBG to say a few words about Bonsai and the relationship between Environmental Science program at WU and the Consevancy at NBG or the plans for a new Japanese garden now in the works.

"In 1573, I went to Wu Tai Shan. I bought a copy of The Life Story of Qing Liang and visited the 
places mentioned in the text. I found Han Shan (Silly) Mountain so serene and strangely beautiful 
that I decided to appropriate its name for myself. The mountain inspired me to compose the 
following poem:

    This Silly Mountain doesn’t go around aping people,
    Playing the clown, society’s fool.
    It sits here alone, contented in solitude, perfect in peace.
    I should be so silly."
